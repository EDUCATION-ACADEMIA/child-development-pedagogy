<meta name="description" content="In a finch population, if finches having large beaks and finches having small beaks increase in numbers while finches with average beaks decreases is directional selection.A more classic example of disruptive selection is the beak size of finches on the Galapagos Islands that was studied by Darwin. Because the majority of seeds found on some of the islands were either large or small, finches with large and small beaks (no medium-sized beaks) were favored on those islands.Finches on Santa Cruz Island On Santa Cruz Island, disruptive selection was seen causing speciation in the population of finches that resides there. Due to forces of disruptive selection, intermediate beak sizes have been selected against for generations. The resulting population has almost no medium sized beaks.Why do you think the average beak depth of the birds increased? Because the drought reduced the number of seeds and finches with bigger beaks were able to eat the larger and harder seeds so more of them survived.In other words, beaks changed as the birds developed different tastes for fruits, seeds, or insects picked from the ground or cacti. Long, pointed beaks made some of them more fit for picking seeds out of cactus fruits. Shorter, stouter beaks served best for eating seeds found on the ground.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-In a finch population, if finches having large beaks and finches having small beaks increase in numbers while finches with average beaks decreases is directional selection.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A more classic example of disruptive selection is the beak size of finches on the Galapagos Islands that was studied by Darwin. Because the majority of seeds found on some of the islands were either large or small, finches with large and small beaks (no medium-sized beaks) were favored on those islands.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Finches on Santa Cruz Island On Santa Cruz Island, disruptive selection was seen causing speciation in the population of finches that resides there. Due to forces of disruptive selection, intermediate beak sizes have been selected against for generations. The resulting population has almost no medium sized beaks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Why do you think the average beak depth of the birds increased? Because the drought reduced the number of seeds and finches with bigger beaks were able to eat the larger and harder seeds so more of them survived.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-In other words, beaks changed as the birds developed different tastes for fruits, seeds, or insects picked from the ground or cacti. Long, pointed beaks made some of them more fit for picking seeds out of cactus fruits. Shorter, stouter beaks served best for eating seeds found on the ground.
