This house is as clean as a whistle.Thoroughly or neatly done; also, pure, unsoiled. The early nineteenth-century use of this term, which appears in William Carrs The Dialect of Craven (1828) as a proverbial simile meaning wholly or entirely, was in such guise as Head taken off as clean as a whistle (W. S. Mayo, Kaloolah, 1849).From Modern English Svartengren listed clean as a babys leg, clean as new preen, clean as print, clean as wheat, clean as a leek, clean as carrot, clean as a mackerel (or smelt), clean as a (new) penny, clean as a new pin, clean as a razor, clean as a pick, clean as a pink, and clean as a whistle.For many of you, clean as a whistle probably means really clean, as in not dirty. For example, The sink was clean as a whistle after he scrubbed it. Or maybe youd say something like, Since shes never even had a speeding ticket, her record is clean as a whistle.The phrase originates in the work of Scotlands national poet, Robert Burns. In his 1786 poem, The Authors Earnest Cry and Prayer, he wrote her mutchkin stowp as tooms a whissle. Translated into a modern English dialect, that means that the protagonists bucket is as empty as a whistle.">
