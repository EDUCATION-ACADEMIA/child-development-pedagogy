<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Linguists ultimately concluded that because Genie had not learned a first language before the critical period had ended, she was unable to fully acquire a language. Furthermore, despite the clear improvements in her conversational competence it remained very low, and her vocalizations remained highly atypical.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Why, when found, was Genie unable to speak coherently or understand language? Genie was raised in isolation and was not around the English language much if at all. Genie was never exposed to or taught signs, meanings, or grammar.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Upon her initial arrival at UCLA, Genie weighed just 59 pounds and moved with a strange “bunny walk.” She often spat and was unable to straighten her arms and legs. Silent, incontinent, and unable to chew, she initially seemed only able to recognize her own name and the word “sorry."
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Despite the tragedy that surrounds the case of Genie, her case teaches us an important lesson about language abilities. Telling a story (not necessarily in a grammatical way or even by using words) as well as understanding language are very different from being able to produce grammatical sentences in a language.
