<strong> Mr. Jones gave his first-grade students some simple sorting and counting problems to work on. He noticed that the children, working independently, readily solved the problems, however, there was some self-talk, or “private speech.” According to Vygotsky, what is likely to happen to children’s self-talk if Mr. Jones gives the children a more challenging task to solve? 
</strong>
<p>(A) The amount of private speech should decrease because the children have to concentrate harder. 
</p>
<p>(B) The amount of private speech should remain the same because private speech is a natural part of development. 
</p>
<p>(C) ** The amount of private speech should increase because it facilitates problem solving through self-communication. 
</p>
<p>(D) The self-talk will stop.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Vygotsky claimed that we are born with four ‘elementary mental functions’ : Attention, Sensation, Perception, and Memory. It is our social and cultural environment that allows us to use these elementary skills to develop and finally gain ‘higher mental functions. ‘
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Vygotsky’s theory is considered to be a social constructivist approach because it emphasizes the social contexts of learning and that knowledge is mutually built and constructed.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Hence, from the above-mentioned points, it becomes clear that ‘private speech’ is the term used by Lev Vygotsky to describe a child’s act of speaking to herself.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-For example, a child might be shown pennies to represent each sound in a word (e.g., three pennies for the three sounds in “man”). To master this word, the child might be asked to place a penny on the table to show each sound in a word, and finally the child might identify the sounds without the pennies.
