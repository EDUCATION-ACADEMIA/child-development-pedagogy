<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The light energy (from the sun) then triggers a chemical reaction that breaks down the carbon dioxide and water molecules. This process creates a sugar called glucose and also produces oxygen. The glucose is then broken down by organelles called chloroplast and provide the energy needed to grow and repair plants.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Light is an essential environmental factor affecting plant growth, development, and phytochemical biosynthesis over short and long periods of growth as a result of the functionality exerted by radiation intensity and spectral composition.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The light slows stem elongation through hormones that are sent down the stem from the tip of the stem. In the darkness, the hormones do not slow stem elongation. The seeds in the dark-grown condition rely upon the stored chemical energy within their cells (lipids, proteins, carbohydrates) to power their growth.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The plants that were not exposed to light grew 15.7 millimeters more on average, and the difference of growth between no light and half light plants was 7.27 millimeters. In conclusion, the plants that were exposed to no light whatsoever, were the ones who grew significantly larger than the other plants.
