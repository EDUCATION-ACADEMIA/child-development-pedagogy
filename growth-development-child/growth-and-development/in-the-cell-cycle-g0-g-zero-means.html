<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The G0 phase, also known as the resting phase, is the phase of the cell cycle during which a cell is neither dividing nor preparing to divide. During this period the cell performs regulatory and its basic cellular functions. The cell cycle typically refers to the process by which the cell can grow and repair itself.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The G0 phase is a form of the resting state, or quiescence, in which cells reside until they receive appropriate signals-for example, from growth factors-stimulating them to re-enter and progress through the cell cycle.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The G0 phase describes a cellular state outside of the replicative cell cycle. Classically, cells were thought to enter G0 primarily due to environmental factors, like nutrient deprivation, that limited the resources necessary for proliferation. Thus it was thought of as a resting phase.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The interphase is also called as the resting phase. 90% of cell cycle is formed by interphase. Interphase is the phase of the cell cycle in which the cell spends and performs the majority of its time. Then, in preparation for cellular division, it increases in size.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Cells in the G0 phase are not actively preparing to divide. The cell is in a quiescent (inactive) stage that occurs when cells exit the cell cycle. Some cells enter G0 temporarily until an external signal triggers the onset of G1. No more DNA replication or cell division happens at this phase.
