<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-When will my child be able to dress themselves? Children can dress and undress themselves by around the age of 3. This depends on how much practice they’ve had and how much interest they’ve shown. Often, younger children in a family learn how to dress themselves earlier than older siblings did.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Shedding their clothes is a way for toddlers to declare their independence and test their boundaries (a common theme these days, in case you haven’t noticed). By taking off the outfit you painstakingly put on, your little streaker is sending the message: “You might be able to dress me, but you can’t keep me that way!”
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-"Around 18 months of age, and sometimes even younger, toddlers will start undressing themselves because it doesn’t require as much skill, ” says Kenneth Polin, M.D., a pediatrician at Town and Country Pediatrics in Chicago.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-You can start to include your older baby or toddler in getting dressed by letting your child choose clothes and naming them as you put them on your child. And when you decide it’s time to work on this skill with your child, it can help to have some easy clothes on hand. These might include: loose, elastic-waisted pants.
