<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-This process of muscle loss is called atrophy. Bones may lose some of their minerals and become less dense (a condition called osteopenia in the early stages and osteoporosis in the later stages). Tissue loss reduces the amount of water in your body.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-With age, bones tend to shrink in size and density, weakening them and making them more susceptible to fracture. You might even become a bit shorter. Muscles generally lose strength, endurance and flexibility-factors that can affect your coordination, stability and balance.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-In addition to irregular or more frequent periods, loss of estrogen might lead to symptoms like hot flashes, changes in bladder control, sleeping issues, vaginal dryness or irritation and decreased interest in or discomfort during sex.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Muscles are less toned and less able to contract because of changes in the muscle tissue and normal aging changes in the nervous system. Muscles may become rigid with age and may lose tone, even with regular exercise. Bones become more brittle and may break more easily.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-One noticeable change for women as they age is an increase in body fat. It is common to see a decrease in muscle mass, causing your body to feel less strong than it did in your youth. Women may also develop wrinkles from reduced elasticity and firmness of their skin, or thin and graying hair.
