<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-These stem cells are found in small numbers in most adult tissues, such as bone marrow or fat. Compared with embryonic stem cells, adult stem cells have a more limited ability to give rise to various cells of the body. Until recently, researchers thought adult stem cells could create only similar types of cells.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Embryonic stem cells. These result from an in vitro fertilization procedure. They are donated to science. These embryonic stem cells are pluripotent. This means that they can turn into more than one type of cell.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-There are two major classes of stem cells: pluripotent that can become any cell in the adult body, and multipotent that are restricted to becoming a more limited population of cells.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Adult stem cells, also called somatic stem cells, are undifferentiated cells that are found in many different tissues throughout the body of nearly all organisms, including humans.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Stem cells are different from other cells in the body in three ways: They can divide and renew themselves over a long time. They are unspecialized, so they cannot do specific functions in the body. They have the potential to become specialized cells, such as muscle cells, blood cells, and brain cells.
