<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Jamie has a tray of marigold seedings she started from seed. She transplants the seedings from the seedling flat to cell packs when the: First true leaves are on the plant. Chris is interested in producing the most new plants in the shortest time period.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Leaf Petiole Break off a robust leaf, trim the petiole so it is no more than an inch long, apply rooting hormone, and sink the petiole into the rooting mix. The base of the leaf blade should just touch the mix (Figure 12). Place the pot in a plastic bag in a bright spot.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Germination is a stage where the plant grows from a seed. All seeds need moisture, oxygen and right temperature to germinate, or grow. When the seeds start to grow their own roots, stems, and leaves, they are often called sprouts.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Asexual propagation, sometimes referred to as vegetative propagation, involves taking vegetative parts of a plant (stems, roots, and/or leaves) and causing them to regenerate into a new plant or, in some cases, several plants.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Asexual propagation involves taking a part of one parent plant and causing it to regenerate itself into a new plant. Genetically it is identical to its one parent. Asexual propagation involves the vegetative parts of a plant: stems, roots, or leaves.
