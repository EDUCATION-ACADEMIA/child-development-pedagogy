<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Caroline is careful to use tissue culture in laboratory conditions that are aseptic. Therefore, the laboratory environment is: A. Dirty.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Callie is propagating her African violet by taking leaf cuttings. She is confident that leaf cuttings will work because she is using: herbaceous plants.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Gradually reducing watering and then placing the starts outside in a protected spot for three to six days before transplanting can help reduce plant stress and increase plant survival. In addition to temperature regulation, the other most important aspect to greenhouse growing is proper water management.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The term dormancy means the plants have a period of rest. It is a natural part of most plants’ life cycle. When a flower is in a dormant state, it consumes less water and nutrients. Therefore, you shouldn’t fertilize dormants.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Leaf Petiole Break off a robust leaf, trim the petiole so it is no more than an inch long, apply rooting hormone, and sink the petiole into the rooting mix. The base of the leaf blade should just touch the mix (Figure 12). Place the pot in a plastic bag in a bright spot.
