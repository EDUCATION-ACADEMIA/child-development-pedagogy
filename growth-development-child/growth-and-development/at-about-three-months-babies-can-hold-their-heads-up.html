By around 2 months, while shes lying on her stomach, you might notice she can raise her head for just a few seconds at a time. These brief moments help strengthen the muscles in the back of her neck.By the time they are three months old, your baby should be able to lift their head and the top part of their chest well up, and support themselves with their hands when theyre on their tummy . Your baby will probably be strong enough to hold up their head in a car seat or sling.0 – 1 month: In the first month of life, infants are unable to hold their heads up at all. They need to be cradled and have some sort of neck support for feeding, burping and while being held. Despite this, it is recommended that you start doing tummy time for your infant as early as 2weeks old.Thankfully, that all begins to change around 3 months of age, when most babies develop enough strength in their neck to keep their head partially upright. (Full control usually happens around 6 months.)What can your baby do? By now your baby will be starting to experience emotions and communication. They will respond to different expressions, know your voice and will turn to look for you when they hear you. They may start laughing out loud and look around them in wonder – especially at their fingers and toes.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-When your baby is between 1 and 3 months old, she’ll be gradually gaining the strength needed to hold her head up. By around 2 months, while she’s lying on her stomach, you might notice she can raise her head for just a few seconds at a time. These brief moments help strengthen the muscles in the back of her neck.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-By the time they are three months old, your baby should be able to lift their head and the top part of their chest well up, and support themselves with their hands when they’re on their tummy . Your baby will probably be strong enough to hold up their head in a car seat or sling.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-0 – 1 month: In the first month of life, infants are unable to hold their heads up at all. They need to be cradled and have some sort of neck support for feeding, burping and while being held. Despite this, it is recommended that you start doing “tummy time” for your infant as early as 2weeks old.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Thankfully, that all begins to change around 3 months of age, when most babies develop enough strength in their neck to keep their head partially upright. (Full control usually happens around 6 months.)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-What can your baby do? By now your baby will be starting to experience emotions and communication. They will respond to different expressions, know your voice and will turn to look for you when they hear you. They may start laughing out loud and look around them in wonder – especially at their fingers and toes.
