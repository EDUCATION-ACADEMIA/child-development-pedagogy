<strong> Which of the following experiments provides the best way to test the effect of daylight hours on rose bush bloom numbers? 
</strong>
<p>(A) study a single rose bush during different seasons and under different amounts of sunlight to see when it has the most blooms 
</p>
<p>(B) research the kinds of rose bushes that have the highest number of blooms to see how much sunlight they need 
</p>
<p>(C) count rose bush blooms in different parts of the world that have different amounts of sunlight 
</p>
<p>(D) ** collect data on the number of rose bush blooms grown under identical conditions, except for hour of daylight

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Which of the following would provide the best evidence that genetic factors influence the growth of plants? Seeds from several different plants are planted under identical conditions and found to grow at different rates.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-In this experiment, the addition of fertilizer is the independent variable manipulated by the scientist. Plant height is the dependent variable that responds to the change in the independent variable. Each plant is exposed to an equal amount of sunlight, so sunlight is the control variable.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The genotype of a plant affects its growth. For example, selected varieties of rice grow rapidly, maturing within 110 days, whereas others, in the same environmental conditions, grow more slowly and mature within 155 days. A producer has control over the genetic factor by his choice of variety.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Clarification Statement: Examples of local environmental conditions could include availability of food, light, space, and water. Examples of genetic factors could include large breed cattle and species of grass affecting growth of organisms.
