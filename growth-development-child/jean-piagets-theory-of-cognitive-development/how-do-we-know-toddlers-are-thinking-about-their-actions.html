<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-From 18 – 24 months, toddlers are in the Beginnings of Thought stage. This is when toddlers typically learn symbolic thought and begin pretend play. They begin to understand that one thing can represent another. For example, a block can be a cell phone or a paper plate could be a pie.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-12 to 18 months Your toddler may not be saying much yet, but they’re listening and starting to understand. Over the next few months, they’ll try to copy words, and you may hear them babbling away as if they’re having a real conversation. They’ll even practice speech sounds, raising their tone when asking a question.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Cognitive development means how children think, explore and figure things out. It is the development of knowledge, skills, problem solving and dispositions, which help children to think about and understand the world around them. Brain development is part of cognitive development.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-It is a perfectly normal part of development for toddlers to believe that everything is “mine.” As they begin to understand the concept of possession, they are also beginning to test boundaries and gain independence. They are coming to understand that they are separate individuals from others.
