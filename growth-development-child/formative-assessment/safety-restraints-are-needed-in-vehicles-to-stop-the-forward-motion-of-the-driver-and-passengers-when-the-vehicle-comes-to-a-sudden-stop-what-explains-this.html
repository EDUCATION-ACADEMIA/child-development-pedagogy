<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-As per Newton’s first law of motion, when a car abruptly stops or crashes, Due to inertia of motion, a person sitting in a moving car may be pushed forward when the car stops abruptly, potentially causing damage. To prevent the above accident, seat belt must be used while driving car.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-As a more familiar example of inertia, think about riding in a car. You and the car have inertia. If the car comes to a sudden stop, your body tends to keep moving forward. When the car starts moving again, your body tends to stay at rest. You move forward because the car seat exerts an unbalanced force on your body.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Inertia reel seat belts work by holding the passenger in place when a reasonably large force is applied. The inertial reel restricts passenger movement by locking in the seat belt, when a force is applied. This is why the seat belt locks in if you pull the belt too hard.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-While driving, inertia keeps your vehicle moving, unless it is acted upon by something, such as your brakes, the road surface, a fixed object (such as a tree), or another vehicle. Inertia causes your body and loose objects in your car to keep moving forward when your vehicle stops suddenly.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-According to Newton’s first law, a body continues to be in its state of rest or uniform motion along a straight line unless compelled to change that state by an external force. For example: Wearing a seat belt in a car while driving is an example of Newton’s 1st law of motion.
