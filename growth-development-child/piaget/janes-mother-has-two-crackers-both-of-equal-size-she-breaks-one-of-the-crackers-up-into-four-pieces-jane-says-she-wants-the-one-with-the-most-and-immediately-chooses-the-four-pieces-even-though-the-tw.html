<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Egocentrism. Egocentrism refers to the child’s inability to see a situation from another person’s point of view. The egocentric child assumes that other people see, hear, and feel exactly the same as the child does. In the developmental theory of Jean Piaget, this is a feature of the preoperational child.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Sensorimotor stage (0–2 years old) Preoperational stage (2–7 years old) Concrete operational stage (7–11 years old) Formal operational stage (11 years old through adulthood)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The principle of conservation. two equal physical quantities remain equal even if the appearance of one is changed, as long as nothing is added or subtracted. Concrete operational stage.
