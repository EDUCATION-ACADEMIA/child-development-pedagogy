<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Animism is the belief that inanimate objects are capable of actions and have lifelike qualities. An example could be a child believing that the sidewalk was mad and made them fall down, or that the stars twinkle in the sky because they are happy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Preschoolers also tend to give lifelike qualities, such as feelings and thoughts, to inanimate objects like teddy bears and leaves. This kind of thinking is known as animism. To preschool-age children, anything that moves is alive, like a piece of paper blown by the wind or a flowing stream.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Animism. This is the belief that inanimate objects (such as toys and teddy bears) have human feelings and intentions. By animism Piaget (1929) meant that for the pre-operational child the world of nature is alive, conscious and has a purpose.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Animistic thinking in children can be observed when they play with dolls or action figures. When they say things like “the doll is sad", “the doll wants to talk to you", or any other phrases that indicate the belief that those toys possess feelings and intentions, animistic thinking has occurred.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-While grownups know that pets, toys, and parents remain even when out of sight, young babies aren’t too sure. In fact, it’s not until your little one is about 8 months old that they learn that things they thought disappeared forever, really don’t. This realization is called object permanence.
