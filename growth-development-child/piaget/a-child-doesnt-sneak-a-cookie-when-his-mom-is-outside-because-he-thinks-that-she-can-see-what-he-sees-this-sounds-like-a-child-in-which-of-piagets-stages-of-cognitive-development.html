<strong> A child doesn’t sneak a cookie when his mom is outside because he thinks that she can see what he sees. This sounds like a child in which of Piaget’s stages of cognitive development? 
</strong>
<p>(A) sensorimotor 
</p>
<p>(B) ** preoperational 
</p>
<p>(C) concrete operations 
</p>
<p>(D) formal operations 
</p>

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Sensorimotor stage (0–2 years old) Preoperational stage (2–7 years old) Concrete operational stage (7–11 years old) Formal operational stage (11 years old through adulthood)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Due to egocentrism, the child is only concerned with the final outcome of an event rather than another’s intentions. For example, if someone breaks the child’s toy, the child would not forgive the other and the child would not be able to understand that the person who broke the toy did not intend to break it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Piaget believed that children remain egocentric throughout the preoperational stage. This means they cannot understand that other people think in different ways to them or that events that take place are not always related to them.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Egocentrism. Egocentrism refers to the child’s inability to see a situation from another person’s point of view. The egocentric child assumes that other people see, hear, and feel exactly the same as the child does.
