<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Object permanence is the awareness that objects exist even when you cannot see them. Once the child has realized this, they will learn how to search for an object when they cannot see it. This is called directed groping.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The star of the stage: Object permanence This developmental milestone is a primary goal of the sensorimotor stage. It’s your child’s ability to understand that objects and people continue to exist even when they can’t see them. It’s when your child starts to realize the things-and people, like you!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-When Does Object Permanence Occur? Research by Jean Piaget suggests object permanence develops when a baby is around eight months old. According to Piaget’s stages of development, object permanence is the main goal for the sensorimotor stage.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Piaget designated the first two years of an infants lifeas the sensorimotor stage. During this period, infants are busy discovering relationships betweentheir bodies and the environment. Researchers have discovered that infants haverelatively well developed sensory abilities.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-At this time, children also develop the understanding that items still exist when out of sight, which is also known as ‘object permanence’. It is also during the sensorimotor stage that children develop an understanding of ‘cause and effect’, which is their actions have consequences.
