<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The Language Acquisition Device (LAD) is a claim from language acquisition research proposed by Noam Chomsky in the 1960s. The LAD concept is a purported instinctive mental capacity which enables an infant to acquire and produce language. It is a component of the nativist theory of language.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A Language Acquisition Device (LAD) is a hypothetical tool in the human brain that lets children learn and understand language quickly. A theory developed by Noam Chomsky who believed that every child has a Language Acquisition Device.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Children acquire language through interaction-not only with their parents and other adults, but also with other children. All normal children who grow up in normal households, surrounded by conversation, will acquire the language that is being used around them.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Language Learning refers to learning about a language, its sound system, its structure. It is largely an intellectual exercise. Language acquisition means somehow absorbing a target language’s sound system and structure, ideally without ever thinking explicitly about the language’s actual structure.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-For example, if an English-speaking person tries to learn Spanish by taking Spanish classes in a local community college in their town, they are learning Spanish.
