<title>Kyle asked his older sister, Gabby, if he could borrow her car so that he and his friend could go to the beach. Gabby reminded her brother that she never wanted him to drive her car. She suggested, however, that if it was all right with him, they could all go together. Soon after they got to the beach, Kyles friend got ill. Kyle asked Gabby if she could drive his friend home. Gabby refused, saying that she had just come all that way and she was not going to turn around and go right back. Kyle tried unsuccessfully to find a way to get his friend home. Finally, while Gabby was swimming, he wrote her a note telling her he would be back soon as possible, took her car keys, and drove his friend back home.

<p>(A) Stage 2

<p>(B) Stage 3

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Stage four shows the moral development of a person as a part of a whole society. Each person becomes more aware of the impact of everyone’s actions on others and focuses now on their own role, following the rules, and obeying authorities.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Hence, we can clearly infer from the above points that, Social Contract Orientation is the Stage 5 of Moral Development Theory proposed by Lawrence Kohlberg.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-We can conclude that social right is not accepted in Kohlberg’s theory of moral development because social rights is not a part of Kohlberg’s theory.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Punishment is an automatic response of physical retaliation. The immediate physical consequences of an action determine its goodness or badness.
