<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Stage 4: The Law and Order Orientation: There is an orientation towards authority, fixed rules, and the maintenance of social order. Right behavior consists of doing one’s duty, showing respect for established or lawful authority, and maintaining given social order for its own sake.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Stage 4: Law and order orientation The individual now takes into consideration a larger perspective, that of societal laws. Moral decision making becomes more than consideration of close ties to others. The individual believes that rules and laws maintain social order that is worth preserving.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Self–interest This second stage is characterized by a view that right behavior means acting in one’s own best interests. In this stage, they tend to follow the rules of authority because they believe that this is necessary to ensure positive relationships and societal order.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-In Kohlberg’s theory, the society-maintaining orientation is stage 4 of conventional reasoning.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-In Stage four, it is important to obey laws, dictums and social conventions because of their importance in maintaining a functioning society. Moral reasoning in stage four is thus beyond the need for individual approval exhibited in stage three; society must learn to transcend individual needs.
