<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Jack takes the same test of mechanical reasoning on several different days and gets virtually identical scores. This suggests that the test has: high reliability.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-It means that 50 percent of the variation in intelligence within a group of people is attributable to genetic factors. In other words, heritability never pertains to an individual, only to why people differ from one another.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-One way to measure intellectual functioning is an IQ test. Generally, an IQ test score of around 70 or as high as 75 indicates a significant limitation in intellectual functioning.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Current intelligence tests compute an individual’s intelligence score as :-the ratio of mental age to chronological age multiplied by 100. The Flynn effect refers to the fact that :-IQ scores of today’s better fed and educated population exceed that of the 1930s population.
