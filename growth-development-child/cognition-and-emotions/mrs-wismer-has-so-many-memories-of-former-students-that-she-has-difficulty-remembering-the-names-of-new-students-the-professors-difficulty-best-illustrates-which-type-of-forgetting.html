<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Episodic memory is defined as the ability to recall and mentally reexperience specific episodes from one’s personal past and is contrasted with semantic memory that includes memory for generic, context-free knowledge.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Procedural memory is one type of long-term memory, and is associated with the learning and performance of various tasks. If regular memory can be described as having the ability to recall things, procedural memory is more to do with the ‘how to’ of executing certain tasks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Proactive interference is when old memories disrupt the retrieval of new memories. It occurs when you can’t learn a new task because of the older memories embedded in the brain. Because older memories are usually retained in long-term memory, you rehearse them often, making them easier to recall.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Semantic memory refers to general world knowledge that humans have accumulated throughout their lives. This general knowledge (word meanings, concepts, facts, and ideas) is intertwined in experience and dependent on culture.
