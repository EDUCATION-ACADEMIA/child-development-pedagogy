<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Walking through the halls of his high school 10 years after graduation, Tom experienced a flood of old memories. Tom’s experience showed the role of: A)state-dependent memory.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Effective effortful processing strategies include chunking, mnemonics, hierarchies, and distributed practice sessions (which produce results due to the spacing effect). The testing effect is the finding that consciously retrieving, rather than simply rereading, information enhances memory.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Encoding: the processing of information into the memory system. Ex: extracting meaning.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Declarative memory is also known as explicit memory, as it consists of information that is explicitly stored and involves conscious effort to be retrieved. This means that you are consciously aware when you are storing and recalling information.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Source amnesia: attributing to the wrong source an event we have experienced, heard about, read about, or imagined; also known as source misattribution. Source amnesia, along with the misinformation effect, is at the heart of many false memories.
