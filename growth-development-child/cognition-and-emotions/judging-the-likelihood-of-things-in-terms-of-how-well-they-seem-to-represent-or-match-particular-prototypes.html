Representativeness heuristics may lead a person to ignore relevant information, as well as to close-mindedness and stereotypes.Published on December 28, 2022 by Kassiani Nikolopoulou. Revised on January 12, 2023. The representativeness heuristic occurs when we estimate the probability of an event based on how similar it is to a known situation.The representativeness heuristic is a mental shortcut that we use when estimating probabilities. When were trying to assess how likely a certain event is, we often make our decision by assessing how similar it is to an existing mental prototype.The representativeness heuristic involves estimating the likelihood of an event by comparing it to an existing prototype that already exists in our minds. This prototype is what we think is the most relevant or typical example of a particular event or object.Representativeness heuristics are biased judgments made in everyday life. An example of a representativeness heuristic is thinking that because someone is wearing a suit and tie and carrying a briefcase, that they must be a lawyer, because they look like the stereotype of a lawyer.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Representativeness Heuristic: Judging the likelihood of things in terms of how well they seem to represent, or match, particular prototypes. Representativeness heuristics may lead a person to ignore relevant information, as well as to close-mindedness and stereotypes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Published on December 28, 2022 by Kassiani Nikolopoulou. Revised on January 12, 2023. The representativeness heuristic occurs when we estimate the probability of an event based on how similar it is to a known situation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The representativeness heuristic is a mental shortcut that we use when estimating probabilities. When weâ€™re trying to assess how likely a certain event is, we often make our decision by assessing how similar it is to an existing mental prototype.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The representativeness heuristic involves estimating the likelihood of an event by comparing it to an existing prototype that already exists in our minds. This prototype is what we think is the most relevant or typical example of a particular event or object.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Representativeness heuristics are biased judgments made in everyday life. An example of a representativeness heuristic is thinking that because someone is wearing a suit and tie and carrying a briefcase, that they must be a lawyer, because they look like the stereotype of a lawyer.
