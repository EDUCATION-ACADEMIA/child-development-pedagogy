<strong> Why is REM sleep considered a paradox? 
</strong>
<p>(A) our heart rate is slow and steady, while our breathing is highly irregular 
</p>
<p>(B) we are deeply asleep but can be awakened easily 
</p>
<p>(C) ** our nervous system is highly active, while our voluntary muscles hardly move 
</p>

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-During this stage of sleep, an individual has dreams and the brain produces waves similar to that of a person who is awake, explaining why it is sometimes called paradoxical sleep.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is called paradoxical sleep because it involves seemingly contradictory states of an active mind and a sleeping body.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-During REM, the brain is very active, and dreams are at their most intense. But the voluntary muscles of the body-arms, legs, fingers, anything that is under conscious control-are paralyzed. Exactly how the muscles are paralyzed has been a mystery, however.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-What Defines Paradoxical Sleep? The paradox is that even though the brain is quite active during REM sleep, consuming large amounts of energy, the body remains completely inactive.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-REM sleep is also referred to as paradoxical sleep because while the brain and other body systems become more active, muscles become more relaxed. Dreaming occurs due to increased brain activity, but voluntary muscles become immobilized.
